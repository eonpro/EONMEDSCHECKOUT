## Current Request: Switch Back to Native Payment Processing (No Stripe Redirect)

User wants to revert from Stripe Checkout Sessions (redirect) back to native embedded payment within the app. All Stripe product IDs have been configured in Vercel, and webhooks appear to be set up. Need to maintain product-based tracking while keeping payment native.

### Executive Summary

**Goal**: Use embedded Stripe Payment Element while maintaining product-based charge grouping
**Current State**:

- Recently implemented Stripe Checkout Sessions (redirect model)
- All product IDs configured in Vercel environment
- Webhook endpoints exist at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Payment Intent endpoint exists at `/api/payment/create-intent`
- PaymentForm component already supports native Stripe Elements

**Key Requirement**: Keep entire checkout within app (no Stripe window/redirect)

## Original Project Context

We need a from-scratch React + TypeScript project for a 3-step GLP-1 checkout flow (Step 1: medication selection → Step 2: plan & add-ons → Step 3: shipping & payment). It must use TailwindCSS, have modular components (icons, helpers), include pricing logic with dev-only self-tests, and be organized with an enterprise-ready folder structure. We should prepare for integrations (Stripe, address autocomplete, backend APIs), set up GitHub for version control, and configure Vercel for deployment.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

## Flexible Medical Framework Architecture

### Core Framework Design Principles

#### 1. Configuration-Driven Architecture
```typescript
interface MedicationConfig {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'weight-loss' | 'hormone' | 'sexual-health' | 'hair-loss' | 'other';
  intakeForm: IntakeFormConfig;
  qualificationRules: QualificationRules;
  pricingModel: PricingConfig;
  providerRequirements: ProviderConfig;
}

interface IntakeFormConfig {
  sections: FormSection[];
  conditionalLogic: ConditionalRule[];
  validationRules: ValidationRule[];
  languages: ['en', 'es', 'fr']; // Expandable
}
```

#### 2. Dynamic Question Engine
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  type: 'text' | 'select' | 'multiselect' | 'radio' | 'checkbox' | 'number' | 'date';
  label: TranslatableText;
  required: boolean;
  validation?: ValidationRule[];
  showIf?: ConditionalExpression;
  options?: QuestionOption[];
  metadata?: {
    clinicalCode?: string; // ICD-10, SNOMED CT
    riskWeight?: number;   // For scoring algorithms
  };
}
```

#### 3. Rule-Based Qualification System
```typescript
interface QualificationEngine {
  evaluate(answers: PatientAnswers, rules: QualificationRules): QualificationResult;
  
  // Example rules for different medications:
  glp1Rules: {
    bmi: { min: 27, exceptions: ['diabetes'] },
    age: { min: 18, max: 75 },
    contraindications: ['pregnancy', 'thyroid_cancer', 'pancreatitis']
  },
  
  testosteroneRules: {
    gender: ['male'],
    age: { min: 21 },
    labRequired: true,
    contraindications: ['prostate_cancer']
  },
  
  viagraRules: {
    gender: ['male'],
    age: { min: 18 },
    contraindications: ['nitrates', 'recent_stroke']
  }
}
```

### Medication-Specific Configurations

#### Example 1: GLP-1 Weight Loss
```json
{
  "id": "glp1-weight-loss",
  "name": "GLP-1 Weight Management",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "basic-info",
      "questions": ["height", "weight", "target_weight", "dob"]
    },
    {
      "id": "medical-history",
      "questions": ["diabetes", "thyroid_conditions", "pancreatitis", "eating_disorders"]
    },
    {
      "id": "contraindications",
      "questions": ["pregnancy", "thyroid_cancer_family", "men2_syndrome"]
    }
  ],
  "qualificationRules": {
    "auto_approve": "bmi >= 27 && !contraindications.any()",
    "manual_review": "bmi >= 25 && bmi < 27",
    "auto_reject": "contraindications.includes('pregnancy')"
  }
}
```

#### Example 2: Testosterone Replacement
```json
{
  "id": "trt",
  "name": "Testosterone Replacement Therapy",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "symptoms",

    }
  ],
  "qualificationRules": {
    "auto_approve": "testosterone_level < 300 && psa_normal",
    "manual_review": "testosterone_level >= 300 && testosterone_level < 400",
    "lab_required": true
  }
}
```

#### Example 3: Hair Loss Treatment
```json
{
  "id": "hair-loss",
  "name": "Hair Loss Treatment (Finasteride/Minoxidil)",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "hair-assessment",
      "questions": ["hair_loss_pattern", "duration", "family_history", "photo_upload"]
    },
    {
      "id": "medical-check",
      "questions": ["liver_disease", "prostate_issues"]
    }
  ],
  "qualificationRules": {
    "auto_approve": "age >= 18 && gender == 'male' && !contraindications",
    "photo_review": true
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Intake Form Structure

  - Diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2)
  - High blood pressure
  - Heart disease
  - Thyroid conditions
  - Kidney/liver disease
  - Gastrointestinal issues
  - Mental health conditions
  - Eating disorders

#### 3. Medications & Allergies

### Integration Architecture

#### Flow Sequence
```
1. Landing/Marketing Page
   ↓
2. Medical Intake Form (hyeflow-intake)
   ↓
3. Medical Review/Qualification
   ↓
4. Checkout Process (current system)
   ↓
5. Payment & Order Confirmation
```

#### Data Flow Requirements
1. **Intake → Checkout Data Transfer**:
   - Patient qualification status
   - Selected medication recommendation
   - BMI calculation results
   - Any dosage restrictions
   - Patient ID/reference number

2. **Session Management**:
   - Store intake form data temporarily
   - Link intake session to checkout session
   - Maintain HIPAA compliance throughout

3. **Validation Points**:
   - BMI threshold check (usually BMI ≥ 27 or ≥ 30)
   - Contraindication flags
   - Age verification (18+)
   - State licensing validation

### Technical Integration Approach

#### Option A: Iframe Integration
- Embed hyeflow-intake as iframe in main app
- Use postMessage for communication
- Pros: Quick integration, isolated styling
- Cons: Less control, potential UX issues

#### Option B: Component-Level Integration
- Copy intake form components into main app
- Share state management with checkout
- Pros: Seamless UX, full control
- Cons: More development work

#### Option C: Microservice Architecture
- Keep intake form as separate app
- Use API/webhooks for communication
- Store qualification in database
- Pros: Clean separation, scalable
- Cons: More complex infrastructure

### Recommended Approach (Option B + C Hybrid)
1. Copy the hyeflow-intake UI components into our React app
2. Keep backend validation as separate service
3. Use shared session storage for data persistence
4. Implement these connection points:
   - Intake completion → Redirect to checkout with session ID
   - Checkout initialization → Verify qualification status
   - Payment processing → Include intake reference

### Critical Connection Points

#### 1. Qualification Status Transfer
```typescript
interface QualificationData {
  patientId: string;
  qualified: boolean;
  recommendedMedication: 'semaglutide' | 'tirzepatide';
  dosageRestrictions?: string[];
  bmi: number;
  contraindications: string[];
  intakeCompletedAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date; // Qualification expires after X hours
}
```

#### 2. Session Storage Strategy
```typescript
// After intake completion
sessionStorage.setItem('medical_qualification', JSON.stringify({
  status: 'qualified',
  medication: 'semaglutide',
  patientId: 'uuid-here',
  expiresAt: Date.now() + (4 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 4 hours
}));
```

#### 3. Checkout Validation
```typescript
// In GLP1CheckoutPageImproved component
useEffect(() => {
  const qualification = sessionStorage.getItem('medical_qualification');
  if (!qualification) {
    // Redirect back to intake form
    window.location.href = '/medical-intake';
  }
  const qual = JSON.parse(qualification);
  if (Date.now() > qual.expiresAt) {
    // Qualification expired
    alert('Your medical qualification has expired. Please complete the form again.');
    window.location.href = '/medical-intake';
  }
}, []);
```

### Security & Compliance Considerations

1. **HIPAA Compliance**:
   - Encrypt all medical data in transit and at rest
   - Implement audit logging
   - Ensure BAA agreements with all vendors

2. **Data Retention**:
   - Medical intake data: 7 years minimum
   - Temporary session data: Clear after 24 hours

3. **State Licensing**:
   - Verify provider licensing for patient's state
   - Block access from non-serviced states

4. **Age Verification**:
   - Must be 18+ for GLP-1 medications
   - Implement date of birth validation

## Native Payment Integration While Maintaining Product Tracking

### Discovery of Existing Infrastructure

After analysis, we found:

1. **PaymentForm component** already exists with full Stripe Elements integration
2. **Payment Intent API** endpoint at `/api/payment/create-intent` is functional
3. **Webhook handler** at `/api/webhooks/stripe` processes payment events
4. **Stripe libraries** already installed (@stripe/stripe-js, @stripe/react-stripe-js)

### The Challenge: Product-Based Tracking with Native Payment

**Problem**: Payment Intents don't natively support Stripe product IDs like Checkout Sessions do
**Solution**: Enhanced metadata approach with proper product tracking

### Technical Approach

1. **Revert Frontend to PaymentForm**
   - Remove CheckoutForm component (redirect model)
   - Re-enable existing PaymentForm with Payment Element
   - Keep same user flow, just embedded payment

2. **Enhance Payment Intent with Product Metadata**
   - Include product IDs in payment intent metadata
   - Track subscription vs one-time in metadata
   - Use description field for clear Stripe Dashboard visibility

3. **Improved Customer Creation**
   - Create Stripe customer before payment intent
   - Attach payment method to customer for future use
   - Enable subscription creation via webhook after payment

4. **Webhook Processing Enhancement**
   - On payment_intent.succeeded, create subscriptions if needed
   - Use product IDs from metadata to track what was purchased
   - Update order records with Stripe customer ID

### Benefits of This Approach

- ✅ No redirect - entire checkout stays in app
- ✅ Product tracking via enhanced metadata
- ✅ Customer profiles still created in Stripe
- ✅ Supports both subscriptions and one-time payments
- ✅ Better conversion rates (no abandonment from redirect)
- ✅ Full control over payment UI/UX

### Implementation Time

- **Estimated**: 4-6 hours (most infrastructure exists)
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium (mainly configuration changes)

## Original Challenges

- Clear separation of concerns for steps, icons, and helpers to enable future integration work.
- Pricing logic must be pure, testable, and fast to validate with console.assert in dev.
- Address autocomplete and Stripe must be stubbed to enable drop-in later without blocking UI work.
- Tailwind configuration and design tokens should be straightforward; focus on maintainable classes and utility-first styling.
- Vercel SPA rewrites must route all paths to `index.html`.

```

##### Day 3: Multi-tenant Database Architecture
```typescript
// prisma/schema.prisma - Multi-tenant setup per rules
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/catalog"
}

datasource catalog {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("CATALOG_DATABASE_URL")
}

model Tenant {
  id            Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  identifier    String   @unique
  name          String
  auth0Domain   String
  dbUrl         String   // Connection to tenant DB
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  
  @@map("tenants")
  @@index([identifier])
}

// Dynamic tenant connection per rules
export class PrismaService {
  private clients = new Map<string, PrismaClient>();
  
  getClient(tenantId: string): PrismaClient {
    // Dynamic client factory pattern (required)
    if (!this.clients.has(tenantId)) {
      const tenant = await this.getCatalogClient()
        .tenant.findUnique({ where: { identifier: tenantId } });
      
      this.clients.set(tenantId, new PrismaClient({
        datasources: { db: { url: tenant.dbUrl } }
      }));
    }
    return this.clients.get(tenantId);
  }
}
```

##### Day 4-5: Security & Compliance Layer
```typescript
// lib/security/PHIHandler.ts - HIPAA compliance required
import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js';

export class PHIHandler {
  private readonly algorithm = 'AES-256';
  
  // Rule: PHI must be encrypted at rest
  encryptPHI<T>(data: T): string {
    const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
      JSON.stringify(data),
      process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY!
    ).toString();
    
    // Audit trail (required)
    this.auditLog({
      action: 'PHI_ENCRYPTED',
      timestamp: new Date(),
      // NO PHI in logs
    });
    
    return encrypted;
  }
  
  // Rule: Session storage only, never localStorage
  storeSession(data: any): void {
    // Max 4 hour expiry per rules
    const expires = Date.now() + (4 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    sessionStorage.setItem('intake_session', JSON.stringify({
      data: this.encryptPHI(data),
      expires
    }));
  }
}

// lib/audit/HIPAALogger.ts - Append-only audit trail
export class HIPAALogger {
  async log(event: AuditEvent): Promise<void> {
    // Rule: Append-only, never delete/modify
    await prisma.auditLog.create({
      data: {
        ...event,
        timestamp: new Date(),
        // Never include PHI in logs
      }
    });
  }
}
```

#### Phase 2: Medical Framework Core (Week 2-3)

##### Configuration Schema (Schema-first per rules)
```typescript
// config/schemas/MedicationSchema.ts
export interface MedicationConfig {
  id: string;
  name: {
    en: string;  // English required
    es: string;  // Spanish required
  };
  category: 'weight-loss' | 'hormone' | 'sexual-health';
  
  // Dynamic form configuration (not code)
  intakeForm: {
    sections: FormSection[];
    conditionalLogic: ConditionalRule[];
    validationRules: ValidationRule[];
  };
  
  // Qualification rules as data
  qualificationRules: {
    id: string;
    expression: string; // JSONLogic format
    outcome: 'approve' | 'manual' | 'reject';
    message: { en: string; es: string };
  }[];
  
  // FHIR-ready structure
  fhirMapping: {
    resourceType: 'MedicationRequest';
    code: string; // SNOMED CT
  };
  
  // State licensing compliance
  availability: {
    states: string[]; // Approved states
    ageMin: 18;      // Always 18+ per rules
  };
}
```

##### Dynamic Form Engine (Configuration-driven)
```typescript
// features/intake/FormRenderer.tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

export const FormRenderer: FC<{ config: IntakeFormConfig }> = ({ config }) => {
  const { t } = useTranslation(); // i18n required
  const { encryptPHI, storeSession } = usePHIHandler();
  
  const renderQuestion = (question: Question) => {
    // NO hardcoded strings per rules
    const label = t(question.label);
    
    // SVG icons only, no emojis
    const icon = question.icon ? (
      <SVGIcon name={question.icon} className="w-5 h-5" />
    ) : null;
    
    // Progressive disclosure pattern
    if (!evaluateCondition(question.showIf)) {
      return null;
    }
    
    // Render appropriate component
    switch (question.type) {
      case 'text':
        return <TextInput {...question} />;
      case 'select':
        return <SelectInput {...question} />;
      // ... other types
    }
  };
  
  // Handle form submission with PHI protection
  const handleSubmit = async (data: IntakeData) => {
    // Encrypt PHI before transmission
    const encrypted = encryptPHI(data);
    
    // Store in session only (not localStorage)
    storeSession(encrypted);
    
    // Audit the action
    await auditLog({
      action: 'INTAKE_SUBMITTED',
      patientId: data.patientId,
      // NO PHI in logs
    });
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="space-y-6">
      {config.sections.map(renderSection)}
    </form>
  );
};
```

##### Qualification Engine (Deterministic per rules)
```typescript
// features/qualification/RuleEngine.ts
export class QualificationEngine {
  evaluate(answers: IntakeAnswers, rules: QualificationRule[]): Result {
    // Deterministic evaluation (required)
    const results = rules.map(rule => ({
      ruleId: rule.id,
      passed: JSONLogic.apply(rule.expression, answers),
      outcome: rule.outcome,
    }));
    
    // Determine final outcome
    const rejected = results.some(r => !r.passed && r.outcome === 'reject');
    const needsReview = results.some(r => !r.passed && r.outcome === 'manual');
    
    // Audit trail for compliance
    this.auditService.log({
      action: 'QUALIFICATION_EVALUATED',
      rules: results,
      outcome: rejected ? 'rejected' : needsReview ? 'manual' : 'approved',
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });
    
    return {
      status: rejected ? 'rejected' : needsReview ? 'manual' : 'approved',
      results,
      fhirEncounter: this.createFHIREncounter(answers),
    };
  }
}
```

#### Phase 3: Payment Integration (Week 4)

##### Native Stripe Payment (No redirects per rules)
```typescript
// components/PaymentForm.tsx
export const PaymentForm: FC = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const elements = useElements();
  
  // Create payment intent with metadata
  const createIntent = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/payment/create-intent', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        amount: calculateTotal(),
        metadata: {
          tenant_id: getTenantId(),
          medication_id: medication.id,
          plan_type: plan.type,
          // Required metadata per rules
        },
      }),
    });
    return response.json();
  };
  
  // Native embedded payment (no redirects)
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <PaymentElement 
        options={{
          layout: 'accordion',
          // Native UI, no redirects
        }}
      />
      <button 
        type="submit"
        className="bg-black text-white rounded-full" // Pill style per rules
      >
        {t('payment.submit')}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

#### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance (Week 5)

##### Test Coverage (≥80% required)
```typescript
// tests/compliance.test.ts
describe('Project Rules Compliance', () => {
  describe('Security Rules', () => {
    test('PHI never stored in localStorage', () => {
      // Verify no PHI in localStorage
      expect(localStorage.getItem('phi')).toBeNull();
    });
    
    test('All PHI encrypted at rest', () => {
      // Verify encryption
    });
    
    test('Audit trail for all PHI access', () => {
      // Verify audit logging
    });
  });
  
  describe('Payment Rules', () => {
    test('Uses native Stripe Element only', () => {
      // No redirect URLs
    });
    
    test('Webhook signature verification', () => {
      // Security check
    });
  });
  
  describe('i18n Rules', () => {
    test('All strings translated EN/ES', () => {
      // No hardcoded strings
    });
  });
});
```

#### Phase 5: EHR Integration (Week 6)

##### API Gateway (Option B + C Hybrid)
```typescript
// api/ehr/gateway.ts
export class EHRGateway {
  // Following separation of concerns per rules
  async submitIntake(intake: EncryptedIntake): Promise<void> {
    // Transform to FHIR format (required)
    const fhirBundle = this.toFHIRBundle(intake);
    
    // Send to EHR platform
    await this.sendToEHR(fhirBundle);
    
    // Webhook for status updates
    await this.registerWebhook({
      event: 'patient.qualified',
      url: '/api/webhooks/ehr',
    });
  }
}
```

// Three-tier architecture: Frontend Framework → API Gateway → EHR Platform
const EONMedsPlatform = {
  // TIER 1: Patient-Facing Framework (This Project)
  patientFramework: {
    intakeEngine: {
      FormRenderer,      // Dynamic form rendering
      RuleEvaluator,     // Qualification logic

    }
  },
  
  // TIER 2: API Gateway (Integration Layer)
  apiGateway: {
    endpoints: {
      '/patient/intake': 'Submit medical questionnaire',
      '/patient/qualify': 'Check eligibility',
      '/patient/orders': 'Create/manage orders',

      DEACompliance,     // Controlled substances
      FDAReporting,      // Adverse events
    }
  }
};
```

### EHR Integration Strategy

#### Data Flow Architecture
```typescript
// Patient Journey with EHR Integration
interface IntegrationFlow {
  // 1. Intake Data Collection (Frontend)
  patientIntake: {
    demographics: PatientDemographics;
    medicalHistory: MedicalHistory;
    currentMedications: Medication[];
    allergies: Allergy[];
    vitals: { height: number; weight: number; bp?: string };
  };
  
  // 2. API Gateway Processing
  apiProcessing: {
    validateData: (data: PatientIntake) => ValidationResult;
    checkDuplicatePatient: (email: string, dob: Date) => PatientMatch;
    createOrUpdatePatient: (data: PatientIntake) => PatientRecord;
    submitForReview: (patientId: string) => ReviewQueueItem;
  };
  
  // 3. EHR Platform Storage
  ehrStorage: {
    patientProfile: CompletePatientRecord;
    clinicalNote: ClinicalEncounter;
    prescriptionRecord: PrescriptionOrder;
    labOrders?: LabOrderRequest[];
    followUpSchedule: AppointmentSchedule;
  };
  
  // 4. Bidirectional Sync
  dataSync: {
    webhooks: {
      'patient.qualified': 'Notify frontend of approval',
      'prescription.sent': 'Update order status',
      'lab.resulted': 'Show results in portal',
      'provider.note': 'New message for patient',
    };
    polling: {
      orderStatus: 'Every 5 minutes',
      labResults: 'Every hour',
      messages: 'Real-time via WebSocket',
    };
  };
}
```

#### API Integration Endpoints
```typescript
// RESTful API design for EHR integration
const EHR_API = {
  // Patient Management
  'POST /api/v1/patients': 'Create new patient record',
  'GET /api/v1/patients/:id': 'Retrieve patient data',
  'PUT /api/v1/patients/:id': 'Update patient information',
  'GET /api/v1/patients/:id/history': 'Medical history',
  
  // Clinical Workflow
  'POST /api/v1/encounters': 'Create clinical encounter',
  'POST /api/v1/encounters/:id/qualify': 'Submit for qualification',
  'GET /api/v1/encounters/:id/status': 'Check approval status',
  'POST /api/v1/encounters/:id/prescribe': 'Generate prescription',
  
  // Provider Interface
  'GET /api/v1/provider/queue': 'Get review queue',
  'POST /api/v1/provider/review/:id': 'Submit review decision',
  'POST /api/v1/provider/notes/:id': 'Add clinical notes',
  
  // Pharmacy Integration
  'POST /api/v1/pharmacy/send': 'Send prescription',
  'GET /api/v1/pharmacy/status/:rxId': 'Check Rx status',
  'POST /api/v1/pharmacy/refill': 'Request refill',
  
  // Compliance & Reporting
  'GET /api/v1/audit/trail/:patientId': 'HIPAA audit log',
  'POST /api/v1/reporting/adverse': 'Report adverse event',
  'GET /api/v1/compliance/state/:state': 'State requirements',
};
```

#### FHIR Compliance
```typescript
// Use FHIR standards for healthcare interoperability
interface FHIRResource {
  resourceType: 'Patient' | 'Encounter' | 'MedicationRequest' | 'Observation';
  id: string;
  meta: {
    versionId: string;
    lastUpdated: string;
  };
  // FHIR-compliant data structure
  data: any;
}

// Example: Patient resource in FHIR format
const fhirPatient: FHIRResource = {
  resourceType: 'Patient',
  id: 'patient-123',
  meta: {
    versionId: '1',
    lastUpdated: '2025-09-21T12:00:00Z',
  },
  data: {
    name: [{ use: 'official', family: 'Smith', given: ['John'] }],
    birthDate: '1980-01-01',
    gender: 'male',
    address: [{ city: 'New York', state: 'NY', postalCode: '10001' }],
  },
};
```

### Competitive Advantage
- **Unified Platform**: Single source of truth for all patient data
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in HIPAA, state licensing, DEA compliance
- **Provider Efficiency**: Streamlined workflow from intake to prescription
- **Scalability**: Handle millions of patients across multiple medications
- **Interoperability**: FHIR-compliant for healthcare system integration

#### Key Implementation Decisions Needed

**From User**:
1. **Repository Access**: Need to clone/access https://github.com/eonpro/hyeflow-intake
2. **Integration Method**: 
   - Option A: Embed as separate app (iframe/subdomain)
   - Option B: Merge into main checkout app (recommended)
3. **Provider Review**:
   - Instant qualification (algorithm-based)
   - Async review (24-48 hour wait)
   - Hybrid (instant for clear cases, manual for edge cases)
4. **Data Storage**:
   - Where to store medical intake data (AWS RDS, Supabase, etc.)
   - HIPAA compliance requirements
5. **Qualification Rules**:
   - BMI thresholds
   - Absolute contraindications
   - State restrictions

#### Framework Implementation Architecture

```typescript
// Proposed folder structure for flexible framework
src/
  core/
    framework/
      DynamicFormEngine.tsx      // Core form rendering engine
      QuestionRegistry.ts        // All question type components

      RuleBuilder.tsx
      
// Dynamic routing based on medication type
/intake/:medicationType → IntakeWizard (loads specific config)
/admin/medications → Medication configuration UI
```

### Plugin System for New Medications

```typescript
// Example: Adding a new medication type
class MedicationPlugin {
  constructor(
    public id: string,
    public config: MedicationConfig,
    public customComponents?: Map<string, React.Component>,
    public customValidators?: ValidationFunction[],
    public customQualifiers?: QualificationFunction
  ) {}
}

// Register a new medication
const sleepMedicationPlugin = new MedicationPlugin(
  'sleep-aid',
  {
    name: 'Sleep Aid Treatment',
    sections: [
      {
        id: 'sleep-assessment',
        questions: [
          { id: 'sleep_hours', type: 'number', label: 'Hours of sleep per night' },
          { id: 'sleep_quality', type: 'slider', label: 'Rate your sleep quality', min: 1, max: 10 },
          { id: 'sleep_issues', type: 'multiselect', options: ['insomnia', 'apnea', 'restless_legs'] }
        ]
      }
    ],
    qualificationRules: {
      auto_approve: 'sleep_hours < 6 && sleep_quality < 5',
      require_sleep_study: 'sleep_issues.includes("apnea")'
    }
  }
);

// Register the plugin
MedicationRegistry.register(sleepMedicationPlugin);
```

### Dynamic Pricing Configuration

```typescript
interface PricingModel {
  type: 'subscription' | 'one-time' | 'tiered' | 'usage-based';
  basePrice: number;
  tiers?: PricingTier[];
  discounts?: DiscountRule[];
  addons?: AddonPricing[];
}

// Example: GLP-1 Tiered Pricing
const glp1Pricing: PricingModel = {
  type: 'tiered',
  basePrice: 229,
  tiers: [
    { medication: 'semaglutide', dosages: ['0.25mg', '0.5mg'], price: 229 },
    { medication: 'semaglutide', dosages: ['1mg', '2.5mg'], price: 279 },
    { medication: 'tirzepatide', dosages: ['2.5mg', '5mg'], price: 329 },
    { medication: 'tirzepatide', dosages: ['10mg', '15mg'], price: 429 }
  ],
  discounts: [
    { type: 'bundle', months: 3, discount: 0.1 },
    { type: 'bundle', months: 6, discount: 0.15 }
  ],
  addons: [
    { id: 'nausea-relief', price: 39 },
    { id: 'b12-injections', price: 49 }
  ]
};
```

#### Connection Strategy

1. **Session-Based Qualification**:
```typescript
// After successful intake
const qualificationToken = generateSecureToken();
sessionStorage.setItem('qual_token', qualificationToken);
// Store in database with patient data
await api.post('/api/medical/complete-intake', {
  token: qualificationToken,
  patientData,
  qualification: { approved: true, medication: 'semaglutide' }
});
// Redirect to checkout
window.location.href = `/checkout?qual=${qualificationToken}`;
```

2. **Checkout Validation**:
```typescript
// In checkout initialization
const qualToken = new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('qual');
if (!qualToken) {
  window.location.href = '/medical-intake';
  return;
}
const qualification = await api.get(`/api/medical/verify-qualification/${qualToken}`);
if (!qualification.approved) {
  alert('Medical qualification required');
  return;
}
```

#### Phased Integration Approach

##### Phase 1: Standalone Operation (Weeks 1-6)
```typescript
// Framework operates independently with local storage
const StandaloneMode = {
  dataStore: 'PostgreSQL/Supabase',  // Temporary patient data
  authentication: 'Auth0/Clerk',      // Simple auth
  payments: 'Stripe',                 // Direct integration
  notifications: 'SendGrid/Twilio',   // Email/SMS
  
  // Minimal viable product features
  features: {
    intakeForms: true,
    qualification: true,
    payments: true,
    basicPortal: true,
    providerQueue: false,  // Manual review only
    ehr: false,           // No EHR yet
  }
};
```

##### Phase 2: Hybrid Operation (Weeks 7-8)
```typescript
// Framework starts syncing with EHR
const HybridMode = {
  primary: 'Framework Database',      // Still primary data source
  secondary: 'EHR Platform',           // Sync patient records
  
  syncStrategy: {
    patients: 'Real-time webhook',
    orders: 'Batch every hour',
    prescriptions: 'On-demand',
    documents: 'Async queue',
  },
  
  features: {
    ...StandaloneMode.features,
    providerQueue: true,  // Connected to EHR
    basicEHR: true,       // Read-only access
  }
};
```

##### Phase 3: Full Integration (Weeks 9-10)
```typescript
// EHR becomes primary system of record
const IntegratedMode = {
  primary: 'EHR Platform',           // Source of truth
  frontend: 'Medical Framework',     // Patient-facing only
  
  dataFlow: {
    intake: 'Framework → API → EHR',
    records: 'EHR → API → Framework',
    prescriptions: 'EHR → Pharmacy',
    billing: 'EHR → Billing System',
  },
  
  features: {
    ...HybridMode.features,
    fullEHR: true,              // Full CRUD operations
    providerPortal: true,       // Complete provider tools
    insuranceBilling: true,     // Insurance claims
    labIntegration: true,       // Lab ordering/results
    referralManagement: true,   // Specialist referrals
  }
};
```

#### Migration Strategy
```typescript
// Zero-downtime migration from standalone to integrated
const MigrationPlan = {
  step1: 'Deploy framework in standalone mode',
  step2: 'Start collecting patient data',
  step3: 'Build EHR integration in parallel',
  step4: 'Enable read-sync from framework to EHR',
  step5: 'Migrate existing patients to EHR',
  step6: 'Switch to EHR as primary',
  step7: 'Framework becomes frontend only',
  
  rollback: 'Can revert to standalone at any point',
  dataIntegrity: 'No data loss during migration',
  userExperience: 'Seamless for patients',
};

#### Risk Mitigation

1. **HIPAA Compliance**:
   - Use encrypted storage (AES-256)
   - Implement audit logging
   - Secure all API endpoints
   - Regular security audits

2. **User Experience**:
   - Save progress (allow resume)
   - Clear error messages
   - Mobile-optimized forms
   - Spanish translation support

3. **Legal/Regulatory**:
   - State licensing validation
   - Age verification (18+)
   - Proper consent forms
   - Terms of service updates

## For Native Payment Implementation

### Required from User

1. **Stripe Secret Key** for server-side operations (starts with `sk_`)
2. **Decision on payment methods** - Cards only or include wallets?
3. **Database preference** for storing orders (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase?)
4. **Confirmation** to proceed with implementation in Executor mode

### Technical Recommendations

1. **Use Payment Element** instead of Card Element - supports more payment methods automatically
2. **Implement idempotency keys** to prevent duplicate charges
3. **Add rate limiting** on payment endpoints
4. **Store minimal payment data** - only Stripe payment intent ID and status
5. **Use Vercel KV or PostgreSQL** for order storage if no existing database

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Frontend changes (UI remains similar)
- **Medium Risk**: Backend API changes (new endpoints needed)
- **High Risk**: Payment processing errors if not properly tested
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with Stripe test cards before production

## Bug Fixes

## 1. Stripe Payment Processing Error (Fixed)

**Issue**: Payment stayed in "processing" state with error: "You specified 'never' for fields.billing_details.email when creating the payment Element"
**Root Cause**: PaymentElement was configured to never collect email but wasn't providing it in confirmPayment()
**Solution**: Changed email field from 'never' to 'auto' and added defaultValues to pre-fill customer email
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

## 2. Expedited Shipping Not Included in Payment (Fixed)

**Issue**: Expedited shipping ($25) was marked but not included in the payment total
**Root Cause**: Component was passing `subtotal` to Stripe instead of `total` (which includes shipping)
**Solution**: Updated to pass correct `total` amount and display it properly in order summary
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

## 3. Payment Success Flow (Fixed)

**Issue**: Payment was successful but checkout still showed "processing"

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

## 4. Missing Customer Data in Stripe (Fixed)

## Stripe Configuration Status

⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE - Using LIVE Keys Instead of TEST Keys:**

- **Problem**: Checkout is in LIVE mode, rejecting test cards
- **Error**: "Your request was in live mode, but used a known test card"
- **Fix Required**: Replace LIVE keys with TEST keys in Vercel

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Switch to TEST Keys in Vercel**:
   - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` must start with `pk_test_`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` must start with `sk_test_`
2. **Get TEST keys from**: <https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys>
3. **Update in Vercel**: <https://vercel.com/eonpro1s-projects/eonmeds-checkout/settings/environment-variables>
4. **Redeploy after updating keys**

### Testing Status

- ❌ Cannot test until TEST keys are configured
- Price IDs are added but using LIVE environment
- Test card 4242 4242 4242 4242 being rejected
- ✅ Webhook configured: `we_1S9XvVDQlH4O9FhriRYrdBgx`
- ✅ Webhook secret added to Vercel
- ✅ TypeScript errors fixed (Stripe API version updated to 2023-10-16)
- ⏳ Awaiting TEST keys to enable payment testing

## Lessons

### Framework Benefits & Business Value

#### Rapid Medication Expansion
- **Time to Market**: Add new medication in hours, not weeks
- **No Code Changes**: Business users can configure via admin UI
- **A/B Testing**: Test different question flows without deployment
- **White-Label Ready**: Rebrand for partners instantly
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Pre-built for HIPAA, state licensing

#### Scalability Advantages
```typescript
// Adding a new medication is as simple as:
const newMedication = {
  id: 'ketamine-therapy',
  name: 'Ketamine Therapy',
  category: 'mental-health',
  intakeTime: '15-20 minutes',
  sections: [...],
  pricing: { base: 399, frequency: 'monthly' },
  states: ['CA', 'FL', 'TX'], // Available states
  providers: 'psychiatrist' // Required provider type
};

MedicationService.add(newMedication);
// Automatically creates intake form, qualification rules, checkout flow
```

#### Revenue Optimization
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust prices based on demand, location, competition
- **Upsell Opportunities**: Suggest add-ons based on responses
- **Conversion Tracking**: Identify drop-off points per medication
- **Provider Efficiency**: Auto-qualify obvious cases, flag edge cases

#### Example Medication Expansion Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: GLP-1 Weight Loss
2. **Phase 2 (Month 2)**: Testosterone/HRT
3. **Phase 3 (Month 3)**: ED Medications
4. **Phase 4 (Month 4)**: Hair Loss Treatment
5. **Phase 5 (Month 6)**: Women's Health (Birth Control, UTI)
6. **Phase 6 (Month 9)**: Mental Health (Anxiety, Depression)
7. **Phase 7 (Year 2)**: Specialty (Ketamine, Peptides, NAD+)

### Platform Integration Best Practices
- **Phased Approach**: Build standalone first, integrate gradually to reduce risk
- **API First**: Design APIs before implementation for clear contracts
- **FHIR Standards**: Use healthcare standards for future interoperability
- **Webhook Strategy**: Real-time sync for critical data, batch for analytics
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Framework can operate if EHR is down
- **Data Consistency**: Use event sourcing to maintain data integrity
- **Version Control**: API versioning to prevent breaking changes
- **Monitoring**: Track sync status, API health, data discrepancies
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear API docs for all integration points
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests for every data flow

### Medical Intake Form Best Practices
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't show all questions at once - use multi-step forms with clear progress indicators
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-select common options but allow changes (e.g., "United States" for country)
- **Conditional Logic**: Only show relevant questions based on previous answers (e.g., pregnancy questions only for females)
- **Save Progress**: Allow users to save and resume intake forms - medical forms are long
- **Clear Contraindications**: Immediately alert users if they have absolute contraindications rather than making them complete the entire form
- **BMI Auto-Calculation**: Calculate BMI automatically from height/weight, show the result to the user
- **Medication Database**: Use autocomplete for medication names to reduce errors and improve data quality
- **Mobile-First Design**: Many users will complete intake on mobile devices
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Never store PHI in localStorage, always use secure sessions and encrypted storage
- **Timeout Handling**: Medical forms should have longer session timeouts (30-60 minutes) but with security warnings

- Upgrading Vite resolved esbuild advisory; audit checks should run after new installs.
- Keep discriminated union types explicit to avoid TS property errors on optional fields.
- Vercel deployment shows npm warnings for deprecated packages (rimraf, glob, etc.) - these are dependency warnings that don't affect functionality but could be addressed in future updates.
- Always implement complete multi-step workflows - ensure state management allows navigation between steps and actions are triggered at the appropriate step.
- For Google Maps integration, load the API script dynamically with environment variables rather than hardcoding in HTML. This allows secure API key management via Vercel environment variables.
- Stripe API version must match TypeScript types - use '2023-10-16' for compatibility with current @types/stripe-js package. Newer API versions like '2024-11-20.acacia' will cause TS2322 type errors.
- Always use TEST keys (pk_test_, sk_test_, whsec_test_) for development/testing, not LIVE keys.
- Remember to install @types/google.maps for TypeScript support when using Google Maps APIs.
- For multi-month subscription packages, store the total price (not monthly rate) in the price field to ensure correct cart calculations. Display format should show both total and per-month breakdown for clarity.
- **Native Stripe Integration**: Use Payment Element instead of Card Element to support multiple payment methods automatically (cards, wallets, BNPL).
- **Stripe Checkout vs Payment Intent**: Checkout Sessions provide better product tracking but require redirects. Payment Intents keep users in-app but need metadata for product tracking.
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Always check for existing components before creating new ones. PaymentForm was already implemented with full Stripe Elements support.
- **Product-Based Tracking**: When using Payment Intents, include product IDs and subscription details in metadata for proper Stripe Dashboard visibility.
- **Webhook Endpoints**: Vercel functions at `/api/webhooks/stripe` handle Stripe events. Always verify webhook secret is configured.
- **Stripe Webhooks**: Always verify webhook signatures and handle idempotency to prevent duplicate order processing.
- **Payment Intent Pattern**: Create payment intents server-side and only pass client secret to frontend for security.
- **3D Secure**: Payment Element handles SCA automatically, but ensure proper return URLs are configured.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for network failures, declined cards, and authentication challenges.
